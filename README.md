# Data-science
This data science project series guides you through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. The project encompasses the development of a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression, leveraging the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. The project is structured into three main components:

Model Building:

Utilizes Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing.
Implements linear regression using Sklearn for predicting home prices.
Covers essential data science concepts such as outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, grid search (GridSearchCV) for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation.
Python Flask Server:

Develops a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests.
Utilizes the trained model to handle requests and provide real-time predictions.
Website Development:

Creates a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Allows users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
Establishes communication with the Python Flask server to retrieve and display predicted home prices.
